## 2026-01-10: Y H Hui Modification Notes start: 
This YH modified version works under Windows 10 and Windows 11. 
Improvement:  
* 1. accept a csv file in the command line call.
* 2. accept dropping csv file to csvpad.exe
3. updated for compile with Lazarus Release 4.4 (2025-11-10).

* 2026-01-11 note: it turn out that the Aug 23, 2023 verified fix "Fix execution arguments being ignored #4" is much simpler.  
See [https://github.com/EugeneUvin/CSVPad/pull/4/commits/9b86e539e4612b58227d91638ce68faf47f66e7a].
But this verified fix is not committed in the Fork source nor the v1.2 binary from Trustfm.
